## Type parameters

You will often encounter types like `Maybe a` or `Either Text a`. The lowercase variables are type parameters â€“ any other type can be substituted for them. So if you have an expression of type `Either Text a`, it can serve as `Either Text Int`, `Either Text (List Text)` or `Either Text (Maybe a)`. Note that this substitution happens once for all the occurrences of a variable, so `id :: a -> a` can become `id :: Int -> Int`, but not `id :: Double -> Int`.
